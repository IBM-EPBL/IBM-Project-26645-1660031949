  PROJECT OVERVIEW:
                 SMART SOLUTIONS FOR RAILWAYS is to manage Indian Railways isthe largest 
railway network in Asia and additionally world's second largest networkoperated 
underneath a single management. Due to its large size it is difficult to monitor the 
cracks in tracks manually. This paper deals with this problem and detects cracks in 
tracks with the help of ultrasonic sensor attached to moving assembly with help of 
stepper motor. Ultrasonic sensor allows the device to moves back and forth across the 
track and if there is any fault, it gives information to the cloud server through which 
railway department is informed on time about cracks and many lives can be saved. 
This is the application of IoT, due to this it is cost effectivesystem. This
effectivemethodology of continuous observation and assessment of rail tracks might
facilitate to stop accidents. This methodology endlessly monitors the rail stress, 
evaluate the results and provide the rail break alerts such as potential buckling 
conditions, bending of rails and wheel impact load detection to the concerned
authorities.
